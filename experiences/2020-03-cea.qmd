## Context

Working in a CEA LIST research laboratory, I studied generative models to optimized a knowledge transfer method.

## Technical environment

+ **Programming language:** Python
+ **Frameworks/Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras
+ **Operating systems:** Windows/Linux
+ **Tools:** Git

## Completed tasks

+ State of the art on various generative models derived from the auto-encoder (variational, adversarial).
+ Implementation of the generative models to use with the knowledge transfer method
+ Implementation of the method to transfer knowledge from a neural network to another through the generation of training examples.
+ Results analysis and comparison with existing work.

## Results

+ The studied generative models provide better knowledge transfer due to the generation of more relevant training examples.
