## Framatome (Since May 2024)

### Context

In the I&C (Instrumentation and Command-Control) department, I contributed to the validation of several libraries (low level and high level) developed in C. 

### Technical Environment

+ **Programming language:** C89
+ **Softwares:** VectorCast, Visual C 2019
+ **Operating systems:** Windows
+ **Tools:** Dimensions

### Completed Tasks

+ Definition of the testing strategy and redaction of the associated documentation.
+ Implementation of the tests with the software VectorCast for Windows.
+ Implementation of the tests in C for the other operating systems.

## Pyxalis (December 2023 - March 2024)

### Context

Pyxalis develops a star tracker sensor for satellites to control their orbit around the Earth. My mission was to send commands written in a text file (named *Test Vector*) from a computer to a FPGA board through *SpaceWire* cables. Moreover, images associated with the *Test Vector* needed to be loaded in the SRAM of the board.

### Technical environment

+ **Programming language:** Python 3.6, C++
+ **Frameworks/Libraries:** STAR System API (Python Package)
+ **Operating systems:** Windows
+ **Tools:** Git

### Completed tasks

+ Syntactic analysis of the Test Vector files in Python.
+ Implementation of the Python script that sends the commands from the Test Vector file to the FPGA board.
+ Improvement (with multi-threading) and debug of the C++ code that loads images in the SRAM of the FPGA board.
+ Development of a Python library to allow communication through a dedicated process between the Computer and the FPGA board using SpaceWire cables.
+ Development of a Python library to implement the communication protocol defined by the client.
+ Development of unit tests using **unittest** and **coverage** for the previous library.
