## Context

Working in a CEA LETI research laboratory, I was involved in several projects concerning the development of machine learning models.

## Technical environment

+ **Programming language:** Python
+ **Frameworks/Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, MatplotLib
+ **Operating systems:** Windows/Linux
+ **Other:** Physiological sensors (BioSignal PLUX, Empatica E4, Fitbit Inspire HR)

## Completed tasks

### Development of a relapse detection model for people with bipolar disorder

+ Bibliographic research on relapse detection models.
+ Development of tools for the data acquisition.
+ 6-months acquisition campaign with 10 subjects.
+ Data clean-up and analysis and model training.

### Development of a stress estimation model from physiological signals

+ Definition of the experimental protocol and development of the signal acquisition system.
+ Acquisition campaign with 50 subjects.
+ Data clean-up and analysis
+ Model training

### Development of a inconfort estimation model for children with cerebral palsy

+ The project's main objective was to develop an exoskeleton and to ensure that does not generate discomfort for the children.
+ Contributions to the model development as well as the article writing.

### Software development

+ Development of an internal Python library for model training with a compatibility with the library Scikit-Learn.
+ Maintenance and improvement of the existing signal processing libraries.

### Management

+ Co-supervised a master 2 internship for the relapse detection model.

## Results

+ An article published concerning the discomfort model for children with cerebral palsy (available [here](https://hal.science/cea-04226465/)).
+ An internal report written concerning blood pressure analysis.
